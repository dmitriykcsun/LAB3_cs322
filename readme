This program, catcher, catches signals that are defined by the command line arguments, ex: ./catcher USR1 TERM HUP. The program will exit successfully on 3 TERM signals if TERM is an argument, otherwise the program must be killed by another signal. 

This program works to the specification outlined in Lab3.
